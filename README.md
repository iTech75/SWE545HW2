# SWE545HW2
Second homework project for SWE545

To run the project, please follow the below instructions:

* Caveat: In the bat files location of the python.exe hard coded as c:\\python\python.exe. If your python files are located elsewhere the you have to edit related batch files. Or if python.exe is in your environment settings then you can simply run both related server.py and client.py directly.
